# CST341Project

As part of the Grand Canyon University Software Development certificate program, we have our students work in situations commonly found in a real-world development team.  That includes understanding the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and the Agile methodology. To help deliver a real-world experience, GCU incorporates team-based projects to teach collaboration and communication. This CRUS project starts with a code base and has the students work in teams and follow Agile user-stories to create a fully functioning shopping cart.

## Project Overview
This project pulls together concepts previously covered in other classes within the program.  The students had previously created their MySQL backend applications and used tools like JDBC, MySQL workbench, Maven, MySQL DB, and Eclipse to add CRUD functionality. Part of learning and being prepared to compete in the job world is to continually practice skills and use them differently.  For the previous applications, that student had free reign over the project, table, and Java class structure.  This iteration requires that they all start with some existing code and work within the project's configuration.  

The two newer concepts for this project is the teamwork and the source control aspects.  Students had previously managed code for themselves, but not updates coming from multiple developers. The forking and cloning of repositories, followed by the pushing and pull request processes, introduce additional complexities to source control, especially when their team members attempt to make changes in the same codebases.  Besides the team source control lessons, the students learn to understand project requirements, prioritization, user stories, sprints, stand-ups, and retrospectives.  Even newbie developers participate in the Agile mindset, so demonstrating knowledge based on project experience pays dividends. The primary concepts are working with user stories and completing the stand-up meeting experience. At the end of the project, students produce a complete Agile and project summary to share with their classmates and hopefully with hiring managers to begin their career search.

## Practical Software Project Expereinces
Our Java certificate participants work on projects from planning to maintainence.  This project encompassed the following development pieces from an Agile Methodology perspective:
- Planning
- Prioritzing
- Database design (Mysql on AWS)
- Coding (Java / JDBC)
- Task lists (Agile)
- User stories (Agile)
- Daily stand-ups (Agile)
- Testing (JUnit)
- Collaborating (GitHub)
- Refactoring

## Tools
Justing learning the syntax of Java code can be over-whelming enough.  But to prepare our Java certificate students for their first meaningful job in software development, we have to teach them some of the tool they will be using.
- Eclipse
- Java JDK
- Git and GitHub
- MySql and MySql Workbench

## Future Enhancments
The project only touches on some of the concepts already learned.  Once the studenst graduate, we hope they will continue working on improving theor skills by dedicating time to their version of this project.  POssible enhancments include:
- Adding a web front-end
- Utiling Rest API to allow integration points
- Creating test cases and implement the tests
- Designing a deployment strategy to a cloud platform (AZURE, AWS, Google)
- Improving the DB table structure to allow more complicates queries
- Implementing an ORM database interation (Hibernate)
